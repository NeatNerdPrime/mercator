     * and backslash), roughly doubling its size and defeating the length check below — so the
     * array form is passed instead and measured via a single json_encode(), matching what
     * Eloquent will actually store.
     *
     * @param  string  $description  A short description of the action to record (e.g., "created", "updated", "deleted").
     * @param  Model  $model  The Eloquent model instance being audited.
