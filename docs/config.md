# Configuration

This document describes all configuration options available in Mercator, including LDAP integration, Active Directory nested group support, mail settings, caching, and optional features.

Mercator relies on environment variables (`.env`) to configure core features such as authentication, LDAP, auto-provisioning, mail, and security.

---

## LDAP Configuration

Mercator supports both **local authentication** and **LDAP authentication**.
Local accounts always remain available for fallback if configured.

### Enable / Disable LDAP Authentication

```
LDAP_ENABLED=true
```

### Allow local login when LDAP authentication fails

```
LDAP_FALLBACK_LOCAL=true
```

Default: `true` (applies when the variable is missing from `.env`).

When enabled, Mercator tries the **local password** stored in its database whenever LDAP authentication fails, **whatever the reason**:

* LDAP server unreachable, service account bind failure, TLS error
* user not found in the search base, or not a member of `LDAP_GROUP`
* several LDAP entries match the identifier
* **wrong LDAP password** (the directory refused the bind)

A valid local password is therefore always an alternative way to log in, even when the directory rejects the password. Set `LDAP_FALLBACK_LOCAL=false` if LDAP accounts must only authenticate against the directory (local-only accounts such as `admin` can then no longer log in while LDAP is enabled).

The only case where the local password is **not** tried: the directory accepts the password but no Mercator user has this `login` and auto-provisioning is disabled. The login is then refused.

#### Login flow

1. `LDAP_ENABLED=false` → local authentication only.
2. LDAP search for the identifier, then bind with the user's DN and password.
3. LDAP success → the Mercator user with the same `login` is logged in (created if `LDAP_AUTO_PROVISION=true`, refused otherwise).
4. LDAP failure → local authentication if `LDAP_FALLBACK_LOCAL=true`, refused otherwise.

### Automatically create Mercator users from LDAP

If the LDAP user exists but no matching Mercator user is found, Mercator can auto-create the corresponding local account.
The match is made **only** on the Mercator `login` field, which must equal the identifier typed on the login page.

```
LDAP_AUTO_PROVISION=true
```

The local account will be created with the following role:

```
LDAP_AUTO_PROVISION_ROLE=user
```

The value must match the role title exactly (case-sensitive). If the role does not exist, the user is created without a role and a warning is logged.
Auto-provisioned accounts get a random local password: they cannot use the local fallback.

---

### LDAP Connection Settings

```
LDAP_HOST=ldap.example.com
LDAP_USERNAME="CN=ldap-reader,OU=Service Accounts,DC=example,DC=com"
LDAP_PASSWORD="secret"
LDAP_PORT=389
LDAP_BASE_DN="DC=example,DC=com"
LDAP_TIMEOUT=5
LDAP_SSL=false
LDAP_TLS=false
```

These values are passed directly to Laravel's LDAPRecord connection layer.

Passwords are checked against the single server set in `LDAP_HOST`. With Active Directory, if this domain controller has not yet received a password change (replication delay or failure), it only accepts the user's **previous** password.

---

### LDAP User Search Base

Define where users should be searched:

```
LDAP_USERS_BASE_DN="OU=Users,DC=example,DC=com"
```

If empty, Mercator searches from `LDAP_BASE_DN`.

---

### LDAP Login Attributes

Defines which LDAP attributes can be used as a login identifier:

```
LDAP_LOGIN_ATTRIBUTES=sAMAccountName,uid,mail
```

Default: `uid,cn,mail,sAMAccountName,userPrincipalName`.

Mercator will try these attributes with an OR filter. Exactly **one** LDAP entry must match: if several entries match (for example a user and a contact sharing the same `mail` or `cn`), the login is refused. Keep this list as short as possible (e.g. `sAMAccountName` on Active Directory).

---

### LDAP Group Restriction

You can restrict access to Mercator to members of a specific LDAP group.

```
LDAP_GROUP="CN=Mercator-Users,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com"
```

If empty, all LDAP-authenticated users may log in.

---

## Nested Group Support (Active Directory Only)

Mercator can check recursive (nested) group membership when using **Microsoft Active Directory**.

This is disabled by default.

### Enable nested group lookups

```
LDAP_NESTED_GROUPS=true
```

### How it works

When enabled, Mercator uses the AD-specific matching rule:

```
1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941   (LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN)
```

Example LDAP filter generated:

```
(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=CN=Mercator-Users,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com)
```

This allows recognition of:

* Direct membership
* Indirect membership
* Deeply nested groups (multi-level)

### Important limitations

* **Supported only on Microsoft Active Directory**
* Will **not** work on OpenLDAP or other LDAP servers
* If enabled on non-AD systems, LDAP authentication will fail

---

## Email Configuration

Mercator sends notifications, password resets (for local accounts), and system emails.

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=mailer@example.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=secret
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@example.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Mercator"
```

---

## Application-Level Settings

### Application Name

This name is displayed in the top left corner of each page of the application.

```
APP_NAME=Mercator
```

### Mercator Instance Environment

Used to specify the type of the Mercator instance: Production, Development, Integration, Pre-production, Prototype, Mockup…

```
APP_ENV=Production
```

📢 *Note: `APP_ENV=Production` is mandatory to allow HTTPS to work.*

### API Rate Limit

Limits API requests to protect server resources.
Format: `API_RATE_LIMIT` requests per `API_RATE_LIMIT_DECAY` minute(s).

```
    60,1       = 60 req/min    (default - normal usage)
    120,1      = 120 req/min   (development/testing)
    1000,60    = 1000 req/hour (public API)
    10000,1440 = 10000 req/day (third-party integrations)
```

Returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when exceeded.

```
API_RATE_LIMIT=60
API_RATE_LIMIT_DECAY=1
```

### Application URL

```
APP_URL=https://mercator.example.com
```

Used in links, notifications, export URLs, etc.

### Debug Mode

```
APP_DEBUG=false
```

When enabled, errors will be shown on screen. **Do not enable in production.**

### Session Lifetime

```
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
```

---

## Logging

Mercator uses Laravel's logging system. Application logs are written to:

```
storage/logs/laravel.log
```

All levels (including `debug`) are already written to this file: there is no level to raise.

### Login troubleshooting

Every login attempt is traced in `laravel.log` with messages prefixed by `[auth]`, the identifier typed and the client IP (never the password):

| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `Login succeeded.` | Login accepted (roles and number of permissions) |
| `Login succeeded but user has no role.` | Login accepted, but every page will return 403 |
| `LDAP user not found (or not member of LDAP_GROUP).` | No entry found: check search base, filter and group |
| `LDAP identifier collision: multiple entries match.` | Several entries match: the DNs are listed |
| `LDAP bind refused for user.` | The directory refused the password (see `ad_reason` and `host`) |
| `LDAP service bind / connection failed.` | Server unreachable, TLS error or service account (`LDAP_USERNAME`) refused |
| `LDAP OK but no local user with this login.` | Directory OK but no Mercator user with this `login` |
| `Login refused: local authentication failed.` | Local fallback failed (`unknown login` or `wrong local password`) |
| `Login locked out: too many attempts.` | Too many attempts for this identifier from this IP |

For Active Directory, `ad_reason` decodes the sub-code of the diagnostic message: `52e` invalid credentials, `525` user not found, `530`/`531` logon not permitted (time/workstation), `532` password expired, `533` account disabled, `701` account expired, `773` user must reset password, `775` account locked out.

### LDAPRecord logging

To also trace every LDAP operation (search, bind):

```
LDAP_LOGGING=true
```

Logs will appear in:

```
storage/logs/ldap.log
```

If no file appears, ensure directory permissions are correct.

📢 *Note: if the configuration is cached (`php artisan config:cache`), changes to `.env` only apply after `php artisan config:clear` (or a new `config:cache`).*

---

## File Export / Import

Mercator supports Excel and PDF export via:

* `maatwebsite/excel`
* `phpoffice/phpword`

Ensure `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` are writable.

---

## Docker Configuration

### Override environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
environment:
  - LDAP_ENABLED=true
  - LDAP_HOST=ad.example.com
  - LDAP_GROUP=CN=Mercator-Users,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com
  - LDAP_NESTED_GROUPS=true
```

### Volumes required

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./storage:/var/www/mercator/storage
  - ./bootstrap/cache:/var/www/mercator/bootstrap/cache
```

---

## Tips for Production Deployment

* Disable `APP_DEBUG`
* Enable HTTPS
* Use a reverse proxy (Traefik, Nginx)
* Configure automatic backups of the database
* Protect `.env` and `storage/` with proper permissions
* Use LDAP nested groups only if you're on **Active Directory**
